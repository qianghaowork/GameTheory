## 1) Day 1: Game of Stones

Two players (numbered 1 and 2) are playing a game with stones. Player 1 always plays first, and the two players move in alternating turns. The game's rules are as follows:

    In a single move, a player can remove either 2, 3, or 5 stones from the game board.
    If a player is unable to make a move, that player loses the game.

Given the number of stones, find and print the name of the winner (i.e. First, or Second) on a new line. Each player plays optimally, meaning they will not make a move that causes them to lose the game if some better, winning move exists.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, T , denoting the number of test cases.
Each of the T subsequent lines contains a single integer, n, denoting the number of stones in a test case.

Constraints

1<= T <= 100

1<= n <= 100

Output Format

On a new line for each test case, print First if the first player is the winner; otherwise, print Second.

Explanation

In the sample, we have T=8 testcases.

We'll refer to our two players as P1 and P2.

If n=1, P1 can't make any moves and loses the game (i.e., the P2 wins and we print on Second a new line).

If n=2, P1 removes 2 stones in their first move and wins the game, so we print First on a new line.

If n=3, P1 removes 2 stones in their first move, leaving 1 stone on the board. Because P2 is left with no available moves, P1 wins and we print First on a new line.

If n=4, P1 removes 3 stones in their first move, leaving 1 stone on the board. Because P2 has no available moves, P1 wins and we print First on a new line.

If n=5, P1 removes all 5 stones from the game board. Because P2 is left with no available moves, P1 wins and we print First on a new line.

If n=6, P1 removes 5 stones in their first move, leaving 1 stone on the board. Because P2 has no available moves, P1 wins and we print First on a new line.

If n=7, P1 can make any of the following three moves:

    1.Remove 2 stones, leaving 5 stones on the board. P2 then removes 5 stones. Because P1 has no available moves, P2 wins.
    2.Remove 3 stones, leaving 4 stones on the board. P2 then removes 3 stones, leaving 1 stone left on the board. Because P1 has no available moves, P2 wins.
    3.Remove 5 stones, leaving 2 stones on the board. then P2 removes the remaining stones. Because P1 has no available moves, P2 wins.

Because all possible moves result in winning, we print Second on a new line.

If n=10, P1 can remove either 2 or 3 stones to win the game, so we print First on a new line. Recall that each player moves optimally, so P1 will not remove 5 stones because doing so would cause to lose the game.

## 2) Day 1: Tower Breakers

Two players (numbered 1 and 2) are playing a game of Tower Breakers! The rules of the game are as follows:

   1. Player 1 always moves first, and both players always play optimally.
   2. Initially there are N towers, where each tower is of height M.
   3. The players move in alternating turns. In each turn, a player can choose a tower of height X and reduce its height to Y, where 1<=Y < X and Y evenly divides X.
   4. If the current player is unable to make any move, they lose the game.

Given the values of N and M, can you determine who will win? If the first player wins, print 1; otherwise, print 2.

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each of the T subsequent lines describes a test case in the form of 2 space-separated integers denoting the respective values for N and M.

Constraints

1<= T <= 100

1<= N,M <= 10^6

Output Format

For each test case, print a single integer (i.e., either 1 or 2) denoting the winner on a new line.

Sample Input

2

2 2

1 4

Sample Output

2

1

Explanation

We'll refer to player 1 as P1 and player 2 as P2.

In the first test case, P1 chooses one of the two towers and reduces it to 1. Then P2 reduces the remaining tower to a height of 1. As both towers now have height 1, P1 cannot make a move so P2 is the winner and we print 2 on a new line.

In the second test case, there is only one tower of height 4. P1 can reduce it to a height of either 1 or 2, but P1 chooses 1 as both players always choose optimally. Because P2 has no possible move, P1 wins and we print 1 on a new line.

## 3) Day 1: A Chessboard Game

Two players are playing a game on a 15 x 15 chessboard. The rules of the game are as follows:

    The game starts with a single coin located at some x,y coordinate. The coordinate of the upper left cell is (1,1), and the coordinate of the lower right cell is (15,15).

    In each move, a player must move the coin from cell (x,y) to one of the following locations:
    1.(x-2, y+1)
    2.(x-2, y-1)
    3.(x+1, y-2)
    4.(x-1, y-2)

    Note: The coin must remain inside the confines of the board.

    The players move in alternating turns. The first player who is unable to make a move loses the game.

Given the initial coordinate of the coin, determine which player will win the game. Assume both players always move optimally.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each of the T subsequent lines contains 2 space-separated integers describing the respective x and y values of the coin's coordinate.

Constraints

## 7) Day 2: Poker Nim

Poker Nim is another 2-player game that's a simple variation on a Nim game. The rules of the games are as follows:

1.The game starts with n piles of chips indexed from 0 to n-1. Each pile i(where 0<=i<n) has chips.

2.The players move in alternating turns. During each move, the current player must perform either of the following actions:
  Remove one or more chips from a single pile.
  Add one or more chips to a single pile.

Explanation

Test Case 0:
Player 1 reduces the second tower to height 1 and subsequently wins.

Test Case 1:
There are two possible moves:

1.Reduce the second tower to 1
2.Reduce the third tower to 1.

Whichever move player 1 makes, player 2 will make the other move. Thus, player 2 wins. 

9) Day 3: Tower Breakers,Again!!!

Two players (numbered 1 and 2) are playing a game of Tower Breakers! The rules of the game are as follows:

    Player 1 always moves first, and both players always move optimally.
    Initially there are N towers of of various heights.
    The players move in alternating turns. In each turn, a player must choose a tower of height X and break it down into Y towers of height Z such that Y>1 and Y x Z = X.
    If the current player is unable to make any move, they lose the game.

Given the value of N and the respective height values for all towers, can you determine who will win? If the first player wins, print 1; otherwise, print 2.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, T , denoting the number of test cases.
Each of the 2T subsequent lines defines a test case. Each test case is described over the following two lines:

    An integer,N , denoting the number of towers.

Explanation

In the first test case, the first player simply breaks down second tower of height 2 into two towers of height 1 and wins.

In the second test case, there are only two possible moves:

    Break the second tower into 2 towers of height 1.
    Break the third tower into 3 towers of height 1.

Whichever move player 1 makes, player 2 can make the other move and win the game.
